The essential selection problem is, given some large number N of solutions,
which n (n<<N) to keep in memory, and which k (k<<n, often k=1) to focus cpu 
on.

The basic model for deciding which solutions are worth keeping depends of
commensurability - given two score vectors x and y, if x is less than y along
some axis and does not exceed y along any axis, then x dominates y, and we can
confidently discard y in favor of x. 

To obtain exactly n soluion, we first partition the population into dominated
and nondominated subsets. In principle the cardinality of nondominated may
range from 1 (a single solution dominates all the others to N (no solution
dominates any other). If we get lucky and |dominated| == n, then we are
done. If not, we follow the psuedocode in the comment below (for the function
competitive-integrate).

how to calculate/update utilities?
how to compute distances between pnodes for rtr?

fixme - remember that we need to add weights to the dimensions
these should be stored in the context when the problem is created

idea for macromutation sizing - use a dirichlet distribution with beta set
according to stuckness (fixme)

fixme - if pnode is for an expr, are utilities for exprs or addrs?
make sure that the utility calculation is invariant up to a
transformation from one equivalent addr to another -
i.e. addr-distance must be a real distance metric...

--

  in the end I've
;;; decided to use crisp dominance instead of graded because it has better
;;; invariance properties (adding constant dimensions doesn't change the
;;; measure) and no magic number. rtr should do a pretty good job of robustly
;;; sizing the rest.

make-pnode should be cached to return an extant pnode if one already exists...

This is not exactly restricted tournament selection - we have a pool of
unique nodes and we want to select a sampling n of the best:

rts(n, nodes, window-size)
let undecided=nodes, winners=nil, losers=nil
while undecided is nonempty
  select window-size + 1 nodes uniformly at random from undecided - if there
  are not enought nodes in undecided, make up the rest from the whole set
  do a restricted tournament, remove the winner from its set and put it in 
  winners, remove the loser from its set and place it in losers

if |winners| >= n
   return rts(n, winners, window-size)
else
   return winners U rts(n-|winners|, losers, window-size)
